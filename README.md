# text_summarization
Text summarization approaches can be split into two groups: extractive summarization and abstractive summarization. Extractive summarization takes out the essential sentences or phrases from the original documents and groups them to produce a text summary without any modification in the original text. Usually, the sentences are in sequence as in the original text document. Nevertheless, abstractive summarization performs summarization by understanding the original text with the help of a linguistic method to understand and examine the text. The objective of extractive and abstractive summarization is to produce a generalized summary, which conveys information in a precise way that generally requires advanced language generation and compression techniques.  To achieve a concise summary, a systematic application of both extractive and abstractive techniques is proposed wherein initially stop words are removed and then pre-processing happens.
